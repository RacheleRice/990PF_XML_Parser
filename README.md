# 990-PF XML Parser

MVP which parses filer/grant info from 990PF XMLs and stores it in a Postgres database.

To run this create a database in PgAdmin called 'grants' 
and change the directory path in the code to your absolute local paths for TY2013 - TY2022. 

For now, you will need to drop the grants table in PgAdmin before running the code again.

Comments/suggestions welcome!
